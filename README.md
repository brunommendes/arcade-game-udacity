# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This is a project from Udacity's Nanodegree program (Front-End Web Developer) based on the arcade game **Frogger**.

## Rules

The goal of the game is to reach the water side while avoiding getting hit by the bugs. 
When the player reaches the water side you won the game, but if you get hit you die and go back to stat.

## Controls

Use the keyboard arrow keys (left,right,up and Down) to control the player movement direction.
